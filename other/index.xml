      <description>Overview Orbit follows the coding standards laid out in this document.
We realize that standards are often contentious and believe that having any standard (even where not everyone agrees) is the best course of action to ensure consistent and readable code across the project.
Naming Conventions Classes / Interfaces Use PascalCase
public interface User extends Actor { } public class UserActor extends AbstractActor implements User { } Enums Use PascalCase for name, SHOUTING_CASE for constants</description>

      <description>Orbit was the recipient of the 2016 Duke&amp;rsquo;s Choice Award for Open Source.
From Joe Hegarty, Lead Engineer:  Hi Everyone,
I was honored to travel to JavaOne in San Francisco to accept the 2016 Duke&amp;rsquo;s Choice Award for Open Source on behalf of the Orbit project. Orbit has been a real team effort ranging from the initial internal engineering efforts at EA and the efforts of our legal team to make Orbit EA&amp;rsquo;s first community project to the amazing contributions from our open source community.</description>

      <description>In this guide we’ll cover how to get a very simple Orbit application running in the form of “Hello World”. It shows using a single-module in a single-process environment, often useful for development purposes.
This tutorial assumes that you have set up a development environment as described in the [[prerequisites|Getting Started: Prerequisites]] document and have some familiarity with Maven based Java projects.
Maven Project The first step is to set up a Maven project that is able to pull in the Orbit dependencies.</description>
